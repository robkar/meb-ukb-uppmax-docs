# UK Biobank genotype data

This file describes the set of UK Biobank genotype data currently available in
the Uppmax/bianca project sens2017519 ("AGE"), PI Sara HÃ¤gg.

The genotype data was released in 2017 and is thoroughly described in [The UK
Biobank resource with deep phenotyping and genomic data (Bycroft et al.
2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0579-z)

## Raw source data

## Raw data updates

Note that when participants withdraw from the UK Biobank, new `.fam` and
`.sample` files are generated with their ID replaced with a negative number, and
the sample count in the filename updated. Please use the most up-to-date files
for any in-progress analyses (but we keep the older files so older analyses can
be reproduced).
