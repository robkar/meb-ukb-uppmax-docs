# UK Biobank genotype data at Uppmax

This is a README for the Uppmax project [Molecular epidemiologic studies of
      aging and age-related
      diseases](https://supr.naiss.se/project/request/?search=sens2017519)
      (sens2017519), which contains a local copy of the genotype data from the
      UK Biobank.

- Instructions for [getting an account and connecting](getting_started_on_uppmax.md)
- A description of [the genotype data](ukb_data_on_uppmax.md) currently available

If you generate a derived dataset that you think would be generally useful,
please consider sharing it with other researchers in the project. Contact PI
Sara HÃ¤gg <<sara.hagg@ki.se>> with details of your derived data.
