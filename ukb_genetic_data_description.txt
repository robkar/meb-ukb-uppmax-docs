This file is a description of the data sets that are available as part of the UK Biobank genotype and imputed data release. Where a file is in a standard format links are given to the format description otherwise explicit format information is given.

This description was created 16 Feb 2018.


Calls
=====
The genotype calls are in binary PLINK format (.bed, .bim, .fam) see https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats for details of the formats.
The BIM file determines the order of markers in the calls and all of the other genotype data sets. The SNP_id is the rsid where it is available or the Affymetrix_SNP_id otherwise. The positions are in GRCh37 coordinates.
The FAM file determines the order of samples in the calls and all of the other genotype data sets. The FAM file includes 'Batch' in the Phenotype field (6th column).

Sample-QC
=========
This file contains information about the samples in the data set.
The samples are in the same order as the calls FAM file. It is a plaintext file with space separated columns.

NOTE: there are currently 2 versions of this file in circulation. The newer
version is described below and contains column headers on the first row.
The older (deprecated) version lacks the column headers and has two
additional Affymetrix internal values prefixing the columns listed below.

Relatedness
===========
This file lists the pairs of individuals related up to the third degree in the data set. It is a plaintext file with space separated columns.

ID1  	  string    sample_id for individual 1 in related pair.
ID2  	  string    sample_id for individual 2 in related pair.

Kinship   numeric   Estimate of the kinship coefficient for this pair based on the set of markers used in the kinship inference (output from KING software). The set of markers is indicated by the field: used.in.kinship.inference


Imputation
==========
The imputed genotype calls are in BGEN v1.2 format (.bgen, .sample, .bgi) see http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/bgen_format_v1.2.html for details of the formats. The sample file lists the order of the samples in the .bgen files. The sample file includes the 'Sex' field for every sample (corresponding to 'Inferred.Gender' in the Sample-QC file). The list of variants in the files can be found with bgenix (https://bitbucket.org/gavinband/bgen/wiki/bgenix). The 1st column of the marker list file is 'alternate_ids' which is a unique identifier for each marker. For markers in the genotype data set 'alternate_ids' is the genotype marker id (rs_id in SNP-QC file). The second column is rsid or the reference panel marker_id, it is not guaranteed to be unique. The alleles in the imputation are aligned with REF/ALT, first_allele is the ref allele on the fwd strand. 


Imputation MAF+info
===================
This file lists the minor allele frequency and info score for each of the markers in the imputed data, calculated using QCTOOL. The order of markers in these files is not guaranteed to be the same as the BGEN files.

Alternate_id
RS_id

Allele1
Allele2
Minor Allele

Haplotypes
==========
The phased haplotypes are in BGEN v1.2 format (.bgen, .sample, .bgi) see http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/bgen_format_v1.2.html for details of the formats. The sample file lists the order of the samples in the .bgen files.


HLA imputation
==============
UK Biobank 500K HLA*IMP2 HLA Release

One file with all loci: A, B, C, DRB5, DRB4, DRB3, DRB1, DQB1, DQA1, DPB1, DPA1.
One line per individual.
The samples are in the same order as the calls FAM file.
Column 1:362 -> one column per possibly imputed allele.  Includes all 11 HLA loci, and all possible alleles for each locus available from HLA*IMP:02.  

The column headers are the allele names.The first part (before the "_") is the locus name e.g. A = HLA-A, DRB1 = HLA-DRB1 etc.The second part (after the "_") is the two field (formerly known as 4-digit) allele name for the locus.  In this case if four digits are reported then the first two digits are the first field and the second two digits are the second field.  The four digits give the 4-digit allele name in old HLA nomenclature.  If three digits are reported, the first field is the first digit with a 0 to be added to the front, and the second field is the last two digits.  In 4-digit notation one adds a 0 at the start. 
For example
DRB1_403 = HLA-DRB1*04:03
whereas
DRB1_1101 = HLA-DRB1*11:01
For more information on HLA nomenclature see http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming.html
For HLA-DRB3, -DRB4, and -DRB5 the allele '9901' indicates that no allele is present (n.b. these loci can have copy number 0).

For each locus there are two imputations, giving the HLA genotype.  Each has an associated probability.  Non-imputed alleles are assigned probability 0 (only the maximum posterior probability alleles and their associated probabilities are reported).  The imputed alleles are indicated by having a non-zero value in the relevant column for a given individual and locus: heterozygotes at a locus each have the maximum posterior probability from HLA*IMP:02 reported (Q2 in the HLA*IMP:02 output); homozygotes have the sum of these probabilities reported.


Intensity
=========
These files contains the A,B intensity data measured by Affymetrix. The files are in a simple custom binary format.
There are two intensity values A,B for each genotype, each represented as a 4-byte float. The set of A,B values for each marker are ordered consecutively by sample (analagous to a matrix with rows=SNPs and columns=Samples) e.g.
SNP_1_SAMPLE_1_A SNP_1_SAMPLE_1_B SNP_1_SAMPLE_2_A  SNP_1_SAMPLE_2_B ... SNP_1_SAMPLE_N_A  SNP_1_SAMPLE_N_B SNP_2_SAMPLE_1_A SNP_2_SAMPLE_1_B ...
Missing pairs of intensities are represented by -1 -1.
The order of the markers and Samples are given by the BIM and FAM files with the calls.

Affymetrix transform the A,B values into 'contrast' and 'strength' for their calling algorithm. If the intensity data is to be used for making cluster plots it is strongly suggested that the transformed values are plotted. The ellipses described by the snp-posterior data are only compatible with the transformed intensity values.
contrast (X) = log2(A/B)
strength (Y) =  log2(AB)/2
Affymetrix called the genotypes in (106) batches of ~4,700 samples. To accurately examine the cluster plots, each batch should be plotted separately for a given marker. For chrX, males and females were called separately, so males and females should be plotted separately for chrX markers. 

Evoker (https://github.com/wtsi-medical-genomics/evoker) can be used to plot cluster plots, following the recommendations above, for the UK Biobank data.


Confidences
===========
These files contain the Affymetrix 'confidence' that a genotype belongs to the call cluster. This is a plaintext file with space spearated columns.
Values are in the range 0-1 with 0 being most confident. Missing values are represented by -1. The order of markers and Samples are given by the BIM and FAM files.


CNV
===
These files contain the B-Allele-Frequency (baf) and Log2Ratio (log2r) transformed intensitiy values for performing CNV calling. There is a separate file for baf and log2r per chromosome. These are plaintext files with space separated columns. The rows corresond to markers (ordered as the calls BIM file) and the columns correspond to samples (ordered as the calls FAM file)
Missing values are represented by -1.


SNP-posterior
=============
These files contain parameters used in Affymetrix's genotype calling algorithm, such as the posterior probability distributions (2-dimensional multivariate Normal) for intensities (in 'contrast' and 'strength' coordinates) of each genotype at each marker. See the Applied Biosystems Axiom Genotyping Solution Data Analysis Guide for more details (http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/axiom_genotyping_solution_analysis_guide.pdf).

Affymetrix provide 33 parameters per marker per batch (3,498 per marker). Each parameter is represented by a 4-byte float. The set of values for each marker are ordered consecutively by batch. This is analagous to a matrix with rows=markers and columns=batch_parameters. The order of the markers and batches are given by the BIM and Batch files. 

Diploid and haploid SNPs are called differently in Affymetrix' calling pipeline. On chrX females are diploid and males are haploid so we get two sets of parameters per SNP per batch. In the .bin snp-posterior chrX file, for each SNP the diploid and then the haploid snp-posteriors are given consecutively. The order of the SNPs is given in the BIM files, the haploid SNPs on chrX are appended with ':1' following Affymetrix' notation. The BIM files for chr1-22,Y,XY,MT are the same as for the calls files, but the chrX SNP-posterior BIM file has twice as many lines. 

The 33 parameters are arranged in four groups. There are 7 parameters for each genotype cluster BB, AB, AA and a fourth set of 12 parameters (CV) from Affymetrix' pipeline which can be ignored for most analyses.

The 7 parameters per genotype cluster are five parameters which define a 2-dimensional multivariate Normal distribution, and two counts of observations (NObsMean,NObsVar) in the order:
mu_X
sigma_X
NObsMean
NObsVar
mu_Y
sigma_Y
cov

Missing values are represented using the IEEE 754 NaN.
